## Description of Project

A mobile first web-app that allows users to vote on the song clips they like or don't like that have been created by other users in the Odeo community.

##Contributions by:

Tommy Carpenito, Amy Foster, Dan Huang, and Jason Smith

##How to use (desktop, samsung tablet, droid, non-iphone products)

Visit singodeo.herokuapp.com and log in with Facebook; you will then be directed to the Odeo home page. Next, you'll automatically hear a short introduction from which you can either swipe left, swipe right, or click one of thes two buttons on the bottom of the screen to begin listening to others singing. If you like what you hear, swipe right (across the casette). If you think the singer could use some practice, swipe left.

Click the red button on the bottom of the screen; a modal will pop up asking if you would like to attach a file of your own. Select from a file on your computer and click upload. If you don't have any current recordings, you have the ability to record your own voice. Afterwards, download the file onto your device and upload the file as an attachment. Don't worry about file format, we'll convert your mp4s, wav's, and other file formats to MP3's!

That's it, you are now a part of the Odeo community. Others will now be able to listen to your singing and can vote on your song clips. The percentage on the top portion of the page will display your overall voice approval. If your number is low, feel free to upload more clips to increase your vocal percentage!

Oh, and don't forget, your uploads will be anonymous, so users won't know who uploaded what clip.


##How to use (mobile apple products)

Unfortunately users with an ipad or iphone will be unable to upload audio clips of their recordings. However, users can still vote on other's clips, listen to music, and enjoy watching their voice approval change over time.
